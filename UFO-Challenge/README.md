# Module 11 Challenge - UFOs
## Purpose
Purpose of this challenge is to add multiple search criteria for data filtering.
## Result
This webpage has five criteria: the date, city, state, country and the shape of the UFO observation. By entering specific restrition(s) in the search fields, the magic filter will go through all the source data and find records that match all the specified criteria. The following images demostrate an example for searching:  
- Search with one criterion: enter a search term: a date: 1/11/2010. The result table on the right returns all the observations occured on Nov. 1, 2010. There are seven UFO observation records on Nov. 1, 2010, as shown in image 1.

 - Search with more criteria: without refreshing the webpage, enter a second criterion, state Florida, "fl". Behind the sceen the webpage will filter the records for observations that occured on Nov.1, 2010 AND happened in state Florida. There are two records matched for both criteria, as shown in the result table.

## Summary
- One drawback of this webpage is that it is not mobile friendly. The webpage auto-adjusts its layout to fit the browser screen, yet as shown in the image below, this webpage, especially the heading image and the text paragraphs are shrinked to the left half side of the mobile screen.

- Recommandations for futher development:
1. A "Clear Filter" option could be added closed to the filter field for clearing the previous entries. Instead of going all the way to the top of the webpage to return to the main page or manually deleting the entered filters, it is easier to just click the "clear filter" button, and the search boxes are available for new entries.
2. A found-record counts. There could be a brief summary of the counts for records that matched all the search criteria.
